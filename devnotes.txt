Near-term goals:

1. Input
I need to have generic input handling like pausing and quitting covered, 
but also have bespoke input for each scene 

2. Scene switching
Once input is figured out, I can assign a temporary keymap to invoke
'change_scene' which will swap scenes that have placeholder text. 
I'll verify that all of my resources are being freed properly with
printf'ing the shit out of every function call.

3. Data Structures
It's about time to address this. I can't be manually freeing every
resource I create. Soon, I will have entities that I will be pushing
and popping from an array... I THINK... On scene change, I'll have to free all of
those resources with a for-loop... I GUESS... Again, I'll use the text that I've 
already got up and running to test out my resource management.


Once these three things are addressed, I'll move on to addressing things like 
drawing shapes, loading pngs, doing physics, all that fun shit. I did text first
because it's simple, and now I can use it as the testing dummy for all of my 
state management in the game.
